Swift Project Structure
=======================

Revised 08/22/13

New projects can be created from the command line via:
	swift create ProjectName

or written from scratch, that command will simply make it easier to start by
creating the initial directory structure and configuration files.

Compiling projects is done from the command line via:
	swift compile DirectoryName
	swift compile filename

All asset files are stored in the JSON format for simplicity and extensibility.
A new, clean project will default to the following directory structure.

/
	fonts			Directory containing all fonts & fonts.json.
	scripts			Directory containing all scripts (entities and classes).
	sounds			Directory containing all sounds & sounds.json.
	states			Directory containing all states & states.json.
	textures		Directory containing all textures & textures.json.
	config.json		Engine/Game configuration.
	project.json	Project/Compiler configuration.

Configuration files (everything JSON) will be compiled into a large
asset BLOB containing textures, sounds, fonts, states and engine/game
configuration. Scripts are compiled into a seperate BLOB and the two
BLOBs are then merged together as a GameData IFF (GDIFF), this is
used by the engine to run the game.
