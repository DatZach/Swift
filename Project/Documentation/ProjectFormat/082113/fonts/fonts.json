	 *	Fonts section describes all fonts that will be

	 *		var text = Text("Hello, World!")
	 *		{
	 *			X = 16,
	 *			Y = 16,
	 *			Font = Assets.Fonts["@Arial"] // or
	 *			Font = Assets.Fonts["Example"]

	 *	Fonts referenced with a @ before the name will be loaded
	 *	from the Operating System's font store. Otherwise they
	 *	will be loaded from the resource data. This allows for
	 *	developers to design faster by not needing to define a
	 *	font in the assets and by cutting back on the compiled
	 *	game size. However for cross-platform support precompiled
	 *	fonts are recommended.
	 *	Note that all attributes related to fonts are changable in
	 *	code, anything defined in these sections only serves as a
	 *	default.
