Versioning
==========

Swift versioning is based around "Semantic Versioning" (http://semver.org/).

Major
	Incremented when major incompatible changes are made.

Minor
	Incremented when functionablity is added in a backwards-compatible manner.
	Incremented when backwards-compatible patches are introduced.
	Reset whenever Major is incremented.

Build
	Incremented when every build.
	Reset whenever Minor is set to 0.

Git Short Tag
	Git short revision tag.
	Makes it easier to find issues when the tool is public.

Example
	1.2.4-ec8e19d
