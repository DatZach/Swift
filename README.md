Swift
=====

A cross-platform Game Engine with a home-brewed Programming Language and IDE.
This project saw development between 2012 - 2014 during my time at College.

While this codebase no longer accurately reflects my skill as a developer, I'm still proud of the code here and the diversity of languages leveraged.
I have redacted the commit history, some contents in source and some files entirely as they contained sensitive information.
This project was originally intended to be a commercial product, but never reached viability before I found work in my field of study.
