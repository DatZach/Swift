How to compile libogg and libvorbis under DJGPP:

Note: these instructions are for compiling libogg v1.0 and libvorbis v1.0.
They may or may not work properly for other versions.

=====

libogg:

In your libogg distribution, open up the file /include/ogg/os_types.h, and
near the end, right after the OS/2 GCC #elif, add the following:

-----
#elif defined (DJGPP)

   /* DJGPP */
   typedef short ogg_int16_t;
   typedef int ogg_int32_t;
   typedef unsigned int ogg_uint32_t;
   typedef long long ogg_int64_t;
-----

Now save the file, and you can compile the lib with the batch file as
instructed in howto.txt.

=====

libvorbis, libvorbisenc, libvorbisfile:

Open up the file /lib/os.h, and near the end, right before the last
#endif, add the following code:

-----
#ifdef DJGPP
#  define rint(x)   (floor((x)+0.5f))
#endif
-----

Now you can compile the source properly under DJGPP.
