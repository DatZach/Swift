DUMBOGG - Release notes.


********************************************
*** Version 0.5, released 16 August 2002 ***
********************************************

This is the first release. It is compatible with DUMB v0.8 and DUMB v0.8.1.
However, it uses undocumented parts of DUMB's API; it may not be compatible
with future versions. Chances are DUMBOGG and DUMB will be upgraded at the
same time, so if you download both you'll be OK.

There's just one point of note in this release. When you call al_start_duh(),
it is your responsibility to pass the correct sampling frequency (you must
pass the same frequency the OGG was encoded at). If you do not, you will
succeed in changing the pitch and speed of the playback, BUT it will not be
the same in future releases. In future releases, resampling will take place
in order to keep the OGG playing at the right pitch. (There will be other
methods for making the OGG play at a different pitch.) So, if you pass a
different frequency, be prepared for your program not to work as you'd like
in future releases.

That's it! Enjoy :)
